# Security Enhancements Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented as part of the Phase 2A emergency security fixes for the Cursuri platform. These changes address critical security vulnerabilities identified in the security audit.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Security

- **Created `.env.example` file**: Added a template file with appropriate security warnings and instructions
- **Enhanced environment variable validation**: Implemented runtime checks to prevent usage of placeholder or development values in production
- **Created `envValidation.ts` utility**: Provides structured validation of environment variables with specific format checks
- **Added security initialization component**: Integrated `SecurityInitializer.tsx` into the app providers to enforce security checks
- **Environment warning banners**: Added visual warnings in development mode for misconfigured security settings
- **Implemented middleware security**: Created security middleware for API route protection
- **Data sanitization**: Added utilities to prevent sensitive data exposure in logs

### 2. Password Security Enhancements

- **Implemented strong password validation**: Created `passwordValidation.ts` utility with comprehensive checks:
  - Minimum length verification (now 8 characters, up from 6)
  - Character type requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
  - Common password prevention
  - Password strength scoring
- **Created reusable React Hook**: Implemented `usePasswordValidation` hook for consistent password validation
- **Added Password Strength UI component**: Created reusable `PasswordStrengthMeter` component
- **Enhanced the Login component**: Added real-time password strength meter and validation feedback
- **Updated password change functionality**: Enforced stronger password requirements in profile settings
- **Added secure password suggestion function**: Can be used to help users create strong passwords

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

- **Fixed error handling in authentication components**: Properly typed error objects to prevent exposure of sensitive information
- **Standardized error handling across components**: Consistent approach to error display and logging

## Configuration Instructions

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual API keys and configuration values
3. Ensure you never commit `.env.local` to version control
4. Make sure `.env.local` is in your `.gitignore` file

### Firebase Security Rules

Previously, we removed hardcoded admin email references from:
- `firestore.rules`
- `storage.rules`
- `adminAuth.ts`

This phase complements those changes with stronger API key and password security.

## Security Best Practices

### API Keys and Credentials

- **Keep credentials out of client code**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
- **Use environment variables**: All sensitive credentials should be in `.env.local`
- **Validate environment variables**: Use the provided validation utilities
- **Rotate credentials regularly**: Establish a process for regular key rotation

### Password Security

- **Enforce strong passwords**: Use the `validatePassword` utility for all password fields
- **Implement password breach checks**: Consider integrating with HaveIBeenPwned API
- **Secure password storage**: Always use Firebase Auth's built-in password hashing
- **Password guidance**: Provide users with clear guidance on creating strong passwords

### Application Security

- **Client-side validation is not enough**: Always validate on the server side as well
- **Use HTTPS everywhere**: Never transmit sensitive data over unencrypted connections
- **Implement proper CORS policies**: Restrict API access to trusted domains
- **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Next Security Enhancement Steps

The following items will be addressed in Phase 2B and 2C:

1. API rate limiting and authorization
2. Comprehensive security headers
3. Secure file upload validation
4. Audit logging system
5. Security monitoring dashboards
