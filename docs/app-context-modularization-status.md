# AppContext Modularization Status Report

## Completed

- âœ… Created core directory structure: `components/contexts/modules`
- âœ… Implemented base functionality in `baseContext.tsx`
- âœ… Implemented cache management in `cacheContext.tsx`
- âœ… Implemented auth functionality in `authContext.tsx`
  - âœ… Enhanced with user preferences management
  - âœ… Added onboarding status support
- âœ… Implemented theme management in `themeContext.tsx`
  - âœ… Enhanced with color scheme management
  - âœ… Integrated with auth context for user preferences
- âœ… Implemented modal management in `modalContext.tsx`
- âœ… Implemented courses management in `coursesContext.tsx`
- âœ… Implemented lessons management in `lessonsContext.tsx`
- âœ… Implemented reviews management in `reviewsContext.tsx`
- âœ… Implemented admin functionality in `adminContext.tsx`
- âœ… Created consolidated providers in `index.tsx`
- âœ… Created compatibility layer in `compatibilityLayer.tsx`
- âœ… Created transition provider in `TransitionProviders.tsx`
  - âœ… Enhanced with automatic onboarding support
- âœ… Updated app providers to use transition system
- âœ… Created migration guide documentation
- âœ… Created example migrated components:
  - âœ… Header component (`MigratedHeader.tsx`)
  - âœ… Onboarding component (`MigratedOnboardingModal.tsx`)

## In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Testing the compatibility layer with existing components
- ðŸ”„ Identifying components for first migration phase
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing the integration between contexts

## Next Steps

- Create unit tests for each context module
- Begin migrating simple components to use specific context hooks
- Update integration tests to work with new context system
- Monitor performance and stability with both systems running in parallel
- Implement additional features in contexts:
  - User activity tracking
  - Enhanced caching strategies
  - Offline support

## Features Added in This Update

- **Enhanced User Preferences**: The AuthContext now properly manages user preferences including theme, color scheme, and notification settings
- **Onboarding Flow**: Added support for tracking and managing user onboarding status
- **Theme Integration**: Theme context now properly integrates with user preferences in Auth context
- **Color Scheme Management**: Added full support for managing color schemes
- **Automatic Feature Detection**: TransitionProviders now automatically enables features like onboarding

## Potential Challenges

- Components that heavily depend on AppContext may require more refactoring
- Some Firebase listeners and caching may behave differently in the new system
- Ensuring consistent behavior between the two systems during transition
- Managing dependencies between contexts (e.g., theme depends on auth for preferences)

## Timeline Update

- Phase 1 (Preparation): Complete
- Phase 2 (Integration Testing): In Progress (Expected completion: May 28, 2025)
- Phase 3 (Component Migration): Starting May 29, 2025
- Phase 4 (Cleanup): Expected June 11-15, 2025
