## 🧪 Debug Logs & Agent Feedback Loop

Why?

To help users and developers quickly fix bugs, debug logs are captured during runtime when the AI agent detects or triggers an error.

What’s logged?

Timestamped logs (UTC format)

Stack traces

User inputs that triggered the error

Context snapshot (state, props, route, etc.)

Suggested feedback: What the user should do or provide to the agent for resolution

Where?

Logs will be logged in the console in the development environment.
In production, logs will be sent to a logging service Firebase for analysis.
This will help the AI agent understand the context of the error and provide better suggestions for resolution.

export const logWithTime = (message: string, ...args: any[]) => {
const now = new Date();
const timestamp = `${now.getHours().toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${now.getMinutes().toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${now.getSeconds().toString().padStart(2, '0')}.${now.getMilliseconds().toString().padStart(3, '0')}`;
console.log(`[${timestamp}] ${message}`, ...args);
};

## logWithTime(`⚠️ WARNING: Attempted to mark item as completed but it has no ID`);

## 💬 Languages

- **HTML** – App markup and semantic structure.
- **CSS** – Custom styling base (used with Tailwind).
- **JavaScript** – Core browser scripting and Firebase SDK.
- **TypeScript** – Typed JavaScript for scalability and safety.
- **Node** – Backend runtime used for server-side code, scripts, and Firebase Functions.

## 📦 NPM Libraries

All libraries used are type-safe, production-ready, and focused on performance and developer experience:

- `tailwindcss` – Utility-first CSS framework.

- `dexie` – IndexedDB wrapper for local storage.
- `uuid` – Generate unique identifiers.
- `@tanstack/react-query` – Data fetching and caching.
- `react-hook-form` – Performant form state management.
- `@hookform/resolvers` – Adapters for Zod/Yup with React Hook Form.
- `i18next`, `react-i18next`, `i18next-http-backend`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector` – Internationalization stack.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Test files are colocated near components or in a `/__tests__/` folder.
- Unit tests written using `jest` and `@testing-library/react`.
- DOM assertions with `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
- Integration tests via `vitest`.
- End-to-end tests using `cypress`.
- Avoid mock data in test files.
- Prefer behavior-driven testing over snapshot testing.

---

## 🔐 Firebase Rules Explained

- `firestore.rules`: Enforces role-based access to documents and collections using Firebase Auth. Rules include read/write conditions tied to user IDs, roles, and timestamps.
- `database.rules.json`: JSON-based structure for Realtime Database; mainly used for synced low-latency state or chat logs.
- `storage.rules`: Restricts file upload/download access. Example: `userId`-based path ownership (i.e., users can only access files in their own bucket path).
- Rules must be tested locally via the Firebase Emulator Suite and deployed using `firebase deploy`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript config. Defines compiler behavior, strictness, JSX settings, path aliases, and project references.
- `tailwind.config.ts`: Tailwind theme config, including custom colors, font sizes, spacing, and dark mode setup via class.
- `postcss.config.js`: Includes TailwindCSS and Autoprefixer as plugins.
- `next.config.js`: Contains experimental flags (e.g., App Router), image domains, i18n config, env vars, and rewrites.

---

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

- Language auto-detected from browser using `i18next-browser-languagedetector`.
- No `/en` or `/ro` segments in the URL path.
- Translations loaded from static or HTTP files via `i18next-http-backend`.
- Fallback language is English (`en`).
- Localization context loaded once on layout using the `useTranslation` hook.

---

## 📄 Documentation Strategy

- `README.md` is the **only documentation file** used in the project.
- There is no external wiki, Notion, Docusaurus, or Storybook.
- Contributors are expected to refer to `README.md`, `ABOUT.md`, and inline comments.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD & Hooks

- There are **no post-merge hooks** defined.

- Pre-commit hooks via `husky` and `lint-staged` are planned but optional.

- Deploys and previews are handled by Vercel.

- Copy errors from terminal or browser console into ChatGPT if context is known.

- If context isn’t known, explain the goal or problem first.

- Ask ChatGPT to think before fixing.

- Always use the check tool to validate errors before asking to fix.

- Ask the AI to run `tsc` or `npm run build` to reveal issues.

- Stop ChatGPT when it's stuck in a loop and prompt a retry.

- On connection errors, say: "continue".

- When the app is already running, say: "dev is already running, check background console and the simple browser that you opened".

- Write clean reusable code, no duplication.
- Document logic with comments.
- Fix all lint and type errors before committing.
- Understand the full context of code before modifying.
- Keep state in central stores (Zustand).
- Always update `/types/index.d.ts` if feature needs it.
- Follow modal and component conventions.

- Fully test all flows:

  - Auth
  - Navigation
  - Purchases
  - Responsiveness (mobile, tablet, desktop)

- Add Firebase rules for every new collection/service.
- Don’t use mock/placeholder data in real tests.
- Don’t refactor blindly — understand before replacing code.

- Track all user roles and actions.
- Improve loading indicators and UX transitions.
- Add illustrations, icons, micro-interactions, onboarding flows.
