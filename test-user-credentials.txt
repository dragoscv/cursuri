Test User Credentials for Cursuri Application
===========================================

Successfully Attempted Registration (but authentication still failing):
Email: testuser2025@example.com
Password: TestPassword123!

Previous Test Attempts:
Email: debuguser2025@example.com  
Password: DebugUser123!

Email: finaltest2025@example.com
Password: FinalTestPassword123!

Backup Test User (if needed):
Email: testuser.backup@example.com
Password: BackupPassword123!

Status: Registration form completes successfully (modal closes), but users are not being properly created in Firebase. Login attempts fail with "Invalid credentials" error.

Issue Identified: The registration process appears to succeed on the frontend (no errors, modal closes) but fails silently on the backend Firebase side. Users are not being persisted to Firebase Authentication.

Created: September 27, 2025
Purpose: Testing authentication and course navigation

Note: All unauthenticated features have been thoroughly tested and work correctly.
